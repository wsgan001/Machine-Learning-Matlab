## Sequential Pattern Mining & Association Rule analysis in multi-perspective Gaze data
The eye gaze data records the ID of ‘region of interest’ and the ‘time duration’ in which the interest is maintained, 
for both child and the parent. This project finds association rules using apriori algorithm for frequently occurring ‘gaze’ behavior 
patterns in relation to child & parent.
